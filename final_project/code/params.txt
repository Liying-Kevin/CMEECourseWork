# 2) DEMOGRAPHIC MODEL

NREF=100000 # reference effective population size
DEMO='' # constant size

# 3) LOCUS AND SAMPLE SIZE

LEN=100000 # length of the locus in bp
THETA=40 # mutation rate in 4*Ne*LEN scale; 40 corresponds to 4e-9 for Ne=100,000 and 100,000 bp length
NCHROMS=100 # number of chromosomal copies to simulate (e.g. twice the number of individuals for a diploid species)

# if you are performing a binary or multiclass classification, you need to define the interval a step, like:
RHORANGE=`seq 20 20 60` # range and step for the recombination rate
NREPL=1000 # this is the number of replicates (simulations) per value of recombination rate to be estimated;

# number of batches for each simulation
NBATCH=10

# nr thread of msms
NTHREADS=4
