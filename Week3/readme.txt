this week learnd about r 
finished the practice about r
I can run r by r or rstudio
TreeHeight.R: is a r file, run it can loads trees.csv in the data directory and calculates tree heights for all trees in the data. Note that the distances have been measured in meters, then creates a csv output file called TreeHts.csv in results that contains the calculated tree heights along with the original data in the following format (only first two rows and headers shown)
Vectorize2.R: is a r file, run it can execute stochastic Ricker model and print the results.
TAutoCorr.R: is a r file, run it can load and examine and plot KeyWestAnnualMeanTemperature.Rdata, and compute the appropriate correlation coefficient between successive years and store it
DataWrangTidy.R: is a r file, run it can convert from wide to long format.
PP_Lattice.R: is a r file, run it should calculate the mean and median log predator mass, prey mass, and predator-prey size ratiocan and create new file in result directory to store the result.
